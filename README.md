# ExamplePronounMCAddon
### An example addon for my Minecraft plugin, PronounMC.
PronounMC originally was meant as a pride month project for 2022, starting development on January 21st 2022 and getting its first release on April 19th 2022.
But development didn't stop there, several updates and even complete rewrites have been made since. 

## What does it do?
It removes the default one/ones pronouns set, and adds the xe/xem pronouns set.
